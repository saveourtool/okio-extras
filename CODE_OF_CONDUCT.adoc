= Code of Conduct
:toc:

This is a small code of conduct to have a good and friendly development in
diKTat.

== Good behavior

We expect everyone to love each other, be kind and polite.
Do not hate anyone for comments on the review or for bugs that he (or she) made
in his code.

== Unacceptable behavior

But if you would like to bully some of our contributors - you are always welcome.
We love critics and do not like to be in comfort zone.
We can even organize some underground boxing match for you somewhere in Russia.
